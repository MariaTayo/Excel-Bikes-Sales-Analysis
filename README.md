# Excel-Bike-Sales-Analysis
This project was part of an analysis of purchased bike sales using Microsoft Excel. I cleaned the data, and then analysed the data using a pivot table. Following analysis, the insights were then visualised using different graphs which was then transformed into a dashboard.

This was part of a project by Alex the Analyst.
